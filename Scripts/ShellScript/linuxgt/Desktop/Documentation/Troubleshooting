If you don't have a raid and/or additional OS, remove os-prober copy+paste the following (as su):

pacman -Rns os-prober

|----------- Troubleshooting -----------|

- installer script hangs:
- umount /mnt -R , then delete, reformat with gparted, then mount.
- do a ls /mnt ; there should only be lost+found before running the installer.

- if dmraid gives an error message, run once more: grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
- remember if install fails, delete and reformat the parition used for Arch Linux
- in the event the script freezes, download gsmartcontrol using pacman, type: 

sudo smartctl -H /dev/sda  #or relevant dev i.e. /dev/sdb

 -- this checks for any disk errors; you can also use the GUI and check for other disk related problems; menu --> GSmartControl

NOTE: GSmartControl doesn't function properly in VirtualBox

No Audio

- open a terminal
- type alsamixer
